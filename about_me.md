Hi there, I'm Rishabh Singhal currently an undergrad student at IIIT Hyderabad studying Computer Science.

This Blog is basically a resource dump for me, I'll be adding new posts and sharing some ideas whenever I come across something new or interesting. :)						

### Life Story

From a very young age, my personality has always been like that of an inquisitive child. I have always been occupied by questions like where do we come from? how this world came into existence? and more. Thanks to my school teachers, who made mathematics interesting and raised my curiosity to learn more. Since then, I have been exploring different fields of mathematics and always living in an awe of how beautiful it is.					

Ever since, I have been looking at the world through the glass of calculations and quantifications, specially, how things work and how we can describe them more formally and mathematically.					

Quoting an instance from my life, I found myself visualising the centroid (or the geometric centre) of three birds flying in the sky, hence I can say that I love finding patterns everywhere, and especially symmetry.					

Since the past two years, my love for mathematics drove me into learning more about other fields. I became interested in Psychology, Fitness, Philosophy, Sciences and Literature.
Coming to my views of the world, I would love it if every human being contributes in helping each other and make this world a better place, a utopia. Where every human being is living in harmony, and everyone's life is blissful.				

I would say IIIT-H played a very big role in my transformation from being just constrained to mathematics to exploring other fields which I never delved into. The opportunities and the work we get at IIIT, always needed something new (which I have never done before) and thus helped me upgrade myself and sign up for new skills.					

Yes, sometimes the workload and academics requires a lot of inputs from oneself, which I like and don't like simultaneously. On one hand, it creates an arena for you to sweep out of your comfort zone, on the other, it can be daunting to do the given amount of work in a tight schedule with a strict deadline.				

My only want is to explore more and gain new life experiences while living in the world peacefully and still being curious to learn something new.
