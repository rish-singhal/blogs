# Why measurement is important?

Let's say we set a goal.

It just acts like a location pointer in the cognitive? map which is temporal as well as spatial? in nature.

Now you basically need one thing i.e. some **measurable quantity which have the following properties.**

- **Property 1:** There exist a comparable function and the set of all the possible measurable quantity is a **[totally ordered set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order)** $$S$$.
- **Property 2:** If $$a, b \in S$$ and $$a \leq b$$ then we say that $$b$$ is an indicator that you are in the right direction.
- **Property 3:** There exists an element $$g$$ (goal) in the set $$S$$ which have the property that

$$ g \geq a\ \ \forall a \in S $$

### Time evolution says you are on the right track!!

Let's say daily at some point of time you are measuring, and as a result of measure you get an element $$d \in S$$, then we can track this value $$d$$ everyday and plot on `x-y axis`

If it is increasing monotonically you are on right track, and by calculating average gradient of this curve one can estimate that goal can be achieved~ and be certain.
