## Monoid

A monoid is a really simple concept which consists of a pair of set of objects
$$S$$ and a binary operator $$\cdot$$ defined on them, such that

1. There exists an identity ($$id \in S$$) such that $$a \cdot id = id \cdot a = a$$ for all $$a \in S$$
2. The binary operator $$\cdot$$ is associative i.e. $$a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a
   \cdot b) \cdot c$$ for all $$a, b, c \in S$$

**Interesting note:** [Klesli Category](https:

it's morphisms as objects.
