## Introduction and Proof

Lemma: $$gcd(a - n, n) = gcd(a, n)$$.

Proof: Let $$g = gcd(a, n)$$, therefore from the definition of gcd, $$g$$ is the largest
number which divides both $$a$$ and $$n$$.

Now, as $$g|a$$ and $$g|n$$ therefore $$g|(a-n)$$. Now to be sure that $$g$$ is
the largest such number, let's assume there exist another $$d$$ such that it is
the largest one rather than $$g$$ that is $$d > g$$, in this case $$d|n$$ and
$$d|(a-n)$$.

From this, $$d$$ must also divide $$n$$. But it can not happen because $$g$$ is
the $$gcd$$ of $$a$$ and $$n$$ and any other number such as $$d > g$$ can not divide
both $$a$$ and $$n$$.

## Generalisation

$$g(a-n, n) = gcd(a, n)$$ can be generalised to $$g(a mod(n), n) = gcd(a, n)$$
as we can subtract $$n$$ from $$a$$ as many times as possible atleast when $$a -
k \times n \geq 0$$

## Eucliedian Algorithm

Using the above number theoretical fact one can prove the correctness of
[Euclidean Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) which
is used to calculate $$gcd$$ of two number in $$O(\log(min(a, b)))$$ time
complexity.
