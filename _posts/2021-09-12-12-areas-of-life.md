1. **YOUR LOVE RELATIONSHIP.** This is the measure of how happy you are in your current state of relationship—whether you’re single and loving it, in a relationship, or desiring one.
2. **YOUR FRIENDSHIPS.** This is the measure of how strong a support network you have. Do you have at least five people who you know have your back and whom you love being around?
3. **YOUR ADVENTURES.** How much time do you get to travel, experience the world, and do things that open you to new experiences and excitement?
4. **YOUR ENVIRONMENT.** This is the quality of your home, your car, your work, and in general the spaces where you spend your time—even when traveling.
5. **YOUR HEALTH AND FITNESS.** How would you rate your health, given your age, and any physical conditions?
6. **YOUR INTELLECTUAL LIFE.** How much and how fast are you growing and learning? How many books do you read? How many seminars or courses do you take yearly? Education should not stop after you graduate from college.
7. **YOUR SKILLS.** How fast are you improving the skills you have that make you unique and help you build a successful career? Are you growing toward mastery or are you stagnating?
8. **YOUR SPIRITUAL LIFE.** How much time do you devote to spiritual, meditative, or contemplative practices that keep you feeling connected, balanced, and peaceful?
9. **YOUR CAREER.** Are you growing, climbing the ladder, and excelling? Or do you feel you’re stuck in a rut? If you have a business, is it thriving or stagnating?
10. **YOUR CREATIVE LIFE.** Do you paint, write, play musical instruments, or engage in any other activity that helps you channel your creativity? Or are you more of a consumer than a creator?
11. **YOUR FAMILY LIFE.** Do you love coming home to your family after a hard day’s work? If you’re not married or a parent, define your family as your parents and siblings.
12. **YOUR COMMUNITY LIFE.** Are you giving, contributing, and playing a definite role in your community?
